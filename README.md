__Data:__ Fuel-Economy Dataset (https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy) provided by the EPA-US.Environmental Protection Agency (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml/). The data is collected from vehicle testing at EPA's National vehicle lab in Michigan. The EPA provide this data to the US government each year to publish their Fuel-Economy guide. we analyize the two dataset from 2008 and 2018.

__Story:__ The fuel-economy of an automobile is the 'fuel efficiency relationship' between 
 - the distance traveled and 
 - the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle. 
Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed.
