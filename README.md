__Data:__ Fuel-Economy Dataset (https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy) provided by the EPA-US.Environmental Protection Agency (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml/). The data is collected from vehicle testing at EPA's National vehicle lab in Michigan. The EPA provide this data to the US government each year to publish their Fuel-Economy guide. we analyize the two dataset from 2008 and 2018. 
 - Model: vehicle make and model 
 - Displ: engine displacement in liters(the size of an engine in liters) 
 - Cyl: number of engine cylinders 
 - Trans: transmission type plus number of gears 
 - Drive: 2-wheel Drive, 4-wheel drive/all-wheel drive 
 - Fuel: fuel type
 - Cert Region: certification region code
 - Stnd: vehicle emissions standard code (https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/federal-and-california-light-duty-vehicle-emissions-standards-airpollutants)
 - Underhood ID: engine family or test group ID. This is a 12-digit ID number that can be found on the underhood emission label of every vehicle. It's required by the EPA to designate its "test group" or "engine family."  (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacarhelp.shtml#airPollutionScore) 
 - Veh Class: EPA vehicle class (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacarhelp.shtml#epaSizeClass) 
 - Air Pollution Score (Smog Rating): (https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/smog-rating) 
 - City MPG: Estimated city mpg (miles/gallon) 
 - Hwy MPG: Estimated highway mpg (miles/gallon)
 - Cmb MPG: Estimated combined mpg (miles/gallon) 
 - Greenhouse Gas Score (Greenhouse Gas Rating): (https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-rating) 
 - SmartWay: based on the greenhouse gas (GHG) and smog ratings found on vehicle fuel economy labels - Yes, No, or Elite (https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/consider-smartwayvehicle)
 - Comb CO2: combined city/highway CO2 tailpipe emissions in grams per mile 

__Story:__ 
The fuel-economy of an automobile is the 'fuel efficiency relationship' between 
 - the distance traveled and 
 - the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle
> Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed.
Possible questions: Are more models using alternative sources of fuel? By how much? How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy? What features are associated with better fuel economy? For all the models produced in 2008 that are still being produced in 2018, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
